/**
 * How a charging session is paid (plan B2.6). One definition for the payment
 * gate on TransactionEvent Started and the settlement on Ended, in this
 * order of precedence:
 *
 * - `roaming`: an OCPI roaming session; the eMSP bills through the CDR.
 * - `free_vend`: the site's free vend; nothing is charged.
 * - `prepaid`: the session's token holds a prepaid balance (OCPP 2.1 C17);
 *   the balance is debited at the end, no card hold.
 * - `invoice`: a driver billed afterwards through an aggregated invoice
 *   (`payment_mode = 'invoice'` on the driver or a fleet); no card hold.
 * - `card`: a driver session, paid with the driver's saved card (hold at
 *   the start, capture at the end).
 * - `guest`: a guest checkout or ad hoc payment session (guest_sessions row);
 *   the hold was placed at checkout and the worker finalizes it.
 * - `anonymous`: none of the above; the gate stops it.
